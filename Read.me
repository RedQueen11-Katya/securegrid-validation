# SECUREGRID Dataset Sorting and Validation Script

## Overview
This repository contains the Python script and dataset used to build and validate SECUREGRID,
a SCADA/ICS-specific vulnerability prioritization model. The methodology integrates multiple
authoritative frameworks and real-time threat intelligence.

### Methodology references:
- IEC 62443 (industrial security levels)
- NIST SP 800-161 (supply chain risk)
- IEEE reliability standards
- Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling
- MITRE ATT&CK for ICS (tactics, techniques, procedures)

## Repository Contents
- `securegrid_dataset_script.py`: Main Python script that:
  - Loads the dataset
  - Extracts and categorizes vulnerabilities by intelligence source
  - Validates schema for all 35 engineered variables
  - Calls FIRST.org EPSS API for exploitation probabilities
  - Runs Anderson-Darling, KS, and Spearman tests
- `SECUREGRID_Dataset_SAMPLE.csv`: Example dataset (10 rows) to demonstrate format.
- `framework_mappings.json`: Maps each of the 35 variables to its authoritative framework source (e.g., IEC 62443, NIST, IEEE).
- `source_columns_template.json`: Shows example CVEs linked to the data sources they were conceptually extracted from.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed.
